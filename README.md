# Random-Forest-with-TidyModels
Random Forest with the R package TidyModels applied to Titanic dataset 

In this code we will see how to use a Random Forest model with the R package Tidymodels. Tidymodels is a framework that facilitates the transition to one algorithm to another. 
The dataset used is the Titanic data and can be find in Kaggle. The question we try to answer with Random Forest is: Â¿Who will survive in the Titanic? 
For those who like the topic can make a cross validation and hyperparameter tunning with Tidymodels.
